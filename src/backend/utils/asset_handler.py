Asset handler for Story 3.2: Copy found images to session assets/ and rewrite refs.

This module provides utilities for:
- Copying images from resolved paths to session assets/ directory
- Rewriting markdown image references to use session-local paths (./assets/basename)
- Handling collisions (last copy wins)
- Preserving file encodings and line endings
- Logging all operations
